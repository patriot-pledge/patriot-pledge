## Overview

*The Patriot Pledge* is a democratic, politically-agnostic document that describes modern political issues and proposes reforms for the U.S. government. Eventually, these will evolve into a set of demands for our legislators and governing bodies.  

**Together, we can form a clear, powerful, and irrefutable statement of demands that are supported by the vast majority of Americans. We will detail reforms that will benefit all.**

This project serves as a working copy, is not considered finalized or complete, and does not officially represent any group or organization. Its contents will evolve as more people contribute.

Using a version control system (VCS) like git (currently hosted on GitHub), anyone can [contribute to the project!](#how-to-contribute)  
It is intended that experts on various topics will submit their own proposals and citations.

### Mission

This project aims to:
- Thoroughly document the issues that have the most significant impact on the welfare of U.S. citizens and residents.
- Propose detailed solutions backed by evidence and experts.
- Provide accessible formats of the final document for all, accounting for language, literacy, reading levels, and disabilities. **Anyone should be able to read the document and decide if it's something they believe in.**
- Empower people to build a unifying, comprehensive proposal for reform of U.S. governing bodies.
